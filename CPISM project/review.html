          <p class="card-text">My 7 year old son just went for his 2nd visit to Well-Key. Both visits were on a Sunday evening. We were in and out in under an hour both times, with hardly any wait time. Even for a weekend night, the staff was super friendly and kind, from check-in to check out. Everyone made sure he got a Popsicle and stickers and said they hoped he felt better. A note for school was ready at check out.  The prescription was ready as soon as we got to the pharmacy. I cannot say enough good things. I’ve told everyone I know what a great place this is! Thanks so much Well-Key!</p>

          <p class="card-text">“Took my 8-year-old daughter for a UTI. The staff was phenomenal and better with kids than most places just for kids. Wish I got their names but the lady at check-in and the nurse or MA who took her vitals you ladies deserve a raise and recognition for your excellent attitudes and service. Much obliged.”</p>

          <p class="card-text">I only had to wait less than 5 minutes. The nurses worked quickly and were polite. Dr. Huskey ran the necessary tests and the examination revealed both a sinus and an ear infection.  She explained my illness and the course of action.  I was extremely pleased with my visit to the Sevierville Well-Key Urgent Care.</p>

          <p class="card-text">My regular doctor had no open appointments so I went to Well-Key. They were very professional
            and very helpful. This was my first visit to a walk-in clinic and needless to say…I picked a great one!</p>

          <p class="card-text">The care was outstanding all the way from start to finish. The Doctor put forth a high level of effort to deliver results. The support staff was very professional and pleasant. The facility was well equipped and designed for patient privacy, service and efficiency. The electronic prescription  process worked great. The insurance was handled equally as well. Recognizing it may be difficult ….. an opportunity for enhancement would be partial merging of the patient data  forms. We will highly recommend “Well-key” at every opportunity. Great JOB !!!</p>

          <p class="card-text">I have an old wrist injury that flared up suddenly 2 days before I needed to be on a plane for a business trip,  (of course, it’s in my writing hand).  It was easy to check in and I was seen very quickly. I explained my problem and received a great short-term solution and felt better within hours. I was given prescriptions to take with me on the trip in case there was any further issues.  Nice people, fast service, great results.  THANK YOU ALL!</p>
